## WHO AM I?
Hi, I'm Ahmet Berke. I am freshman Computer Engineering Student at Kocaeli University. You can reach my social media accounts where you can get to know me in more detail from the bottom of the page :)

## My Interest in Programming
My interest in software and programming started in the 6th grade by typing the Google search engine from the browser and *"Hacked by Ahmettberke"* from the console.
The excitement and enthusiasm this situation gave me at that moment, along with the disappointment I experienced when I renewed the page, dragged me to the concepts of web and programming.

I was introduced to **CSS** and **JS** right after I started learning **HTML**.

At the beginning of the ninth grade, I was curious about **Python** and immediately bought a book and started working. And thanks to this, I have reached real programming pleasure, albeit a little ;) with Python.

In the following periods, technologies such as **C++**, **Golang** and **NodeJS** entered my life and brought me to where I am today.
